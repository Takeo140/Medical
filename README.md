This repository provides a **Formal Verification (Lean 4)** model for genomic and molecular repair. By redefining genetic diseases and cellular anomalies as *"information-space bugs,"* this framework establishes a deterministic mathematical model to derive optimal repair patches (mRNA sequences) to safely and accurately "debug" biological systems.

## 📖 Synopsis

Traditional medicine often relies on statistical outcomes and trial-and-error sequencing. This project shifts the paradigm to **Formal Verification**, treating human biology as an operating system ("Medical OS") and mRNA as the physical delivery protocol for digital-to-biological security patches. 

Through the use of the **Lean 4 interactive theorem prover**, we mathematically prove the existence and safety of optimal repair paths within a finite codon-space.

### Core Logic & Mathematical Framework
1. **Formalized Mapping**: Defining quantitative functional distance ($FD$) between mutant and wild-type sequences.
2. **Cost-Function Optimization**: Balancing repair accuracy, translation/expression efficiency, and biological safety penalties.
3. **Universal Existence Theorem**: Proving that for any finite codon-space mutation, a logically consistent and optimal repair patch exists.

*   `UniversalOptimizationKernel.lean`: The mathematical kernel driving the cost-function optimization for sequence selection.
*   `MCD.lean` (Meta Conflict Detector): Enforces strict safety standards and guards against logical contradictions or adverse cross-reactions.

### 2. Targeted Disease & Genomic Repair Models
*   **Oncology**: `Cancer.lean`, `CancerTotalRepair.lean`, `Cancer_driver_gene_repair.lean`, and `DNA-Cancer.lean`.
*   **Neurology & Neurodiversity**: `Parkinson.lean`, `ALS.lean` (ALS repair modules), `Neural.lean` (Neural OS Debugger), and `Neuro.lean`.
*   **Genetic & Rare Diseases**: `CFTR.lean` (Cystic Fibrosis), `DMD.lean` (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), and `LQTS.lean` (Long QT Syndrome).
*   **Psychiatry & Behavior**: `MentalHealth.lean` and `Drd2.lean`.

### 3. Synthesis & Vector Delivery Protocols
